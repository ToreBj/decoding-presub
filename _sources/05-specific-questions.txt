Use of MMT-7305NA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The instruction manual indicates that the usb stick is intended for
use by patient or doctor to exchange messages between a data
management application and compatible medical devices.  The
instruction manual does not seem to include any instructions
demonstrating use of the usb stick.  It also does not indicate
semantics for messages transferred to remote equipment.

The MMT-7305NA was designed to exchange all messages that remote
equipment supports, but no instructions on usage are available from
its sponsor.

The messages facilitate creating a record of treatment.

The Pre-Sub should include specific questions regarding review issues
relevant to a planned IDE, or marketing application (e.g., questions
regarding pre-clinical and clinical testing protocols or data
requirements) as our advice will be guided by your questions and may
not identify all submission requirements. Appendix 1 of this guidance
contains sections specific to IDE, 510(k), PMA, and HDE that list
examples of questions appropriate to each submission and application
type.
